/**A callback is a function that is executed after another function has finished executing. As we have studied earlier that functions are objects. 
*Functions can take functions as arguments and can be returned by other functions. Functions that take another function as an argument are called
*higher-order functions. So, the callback function can also be defined as any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.
